## Introduction & Core Concepts

- [ ] **Understand What Apache Beam Is**  
  - Unified model for both batch & streaming data processing.  
  - Key “write once, run anywhere” philosophy.

- [ ] **Beam’s Unified Model**  
  - **PCollection**: The basic data abstraction.  
  - **Transform**: Processing steps (e.g., `ParDo`, `GroupByKey`).  
  - **Pipeline**: The overall workflow.

- [ ] **Why Apache Beam?**  
  - Maintain a single codebase for batch and streaming.  
  - Flexibility to run on multiple runners (Dataflow, Spark, Flink, etc.).

**Goal**: Grasp what problems Beam solves and be familiar with its three main abstractions: PCollection, Transform, and Pipeline.

## Building Your First Pipeline

- [ ] **Setting Up the Environment**  
  - Pick a language SDK (Python or Java)  
  - Install the SDK (e.g., `pip install apache-beam` in Python)  
  - Organize your project folder

- [ ] **Hello World Pipeline**  
  - Create a `Pipeline` object  
  - Read input from a simple data source (like a text file)  
  - Apply a simple transform (`ParDo` or `Map`)  
  - Write the output to a sink (e.g., a text file)

- [ ] **Key Pipeline Steps**  
  - Creating and configuring the pipeline  
  - Using common I/O connectors (file-based, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, etc.)  
  - Briefly explore how runners fit in (DirectRunner vs. DataflowRunner, etc.)

**Goal**: Build, run, and understand an end-to-end “Hello World” pipeline.

## Essential Transforms

- [ ] **ParDo (Parallel Do)**  
  - The go-to transform for element-wise operations  
  - Learn about `DoFn` (Java/Python usage)  
  - Example usage: data filtering, data cleaning

- [ ] **GroupByKey & Combine**  
  - Group-based processing for aggregations  
  - Built-in combiners (sum, min, max, etc.)  
  - Writing custom combiners

- [ ] **Windowing Basics (Sneak Peek)**  
  - Difference between bounded vs. unbounded data  
  - Introduction to fixed, sliding, session windows

- [ ] **Composite Transforms**  
  - How to build and reuse complex transforms  
  - Good code organization practices

**Goal**: Learn the transforms used in 80% of day-to-day data processing tasks (map, filter, group, aggregate).

## Handling Streaming Data (Windowing & Triggers)

*(Even if you’re mostly focused on batch processing, knowing these concepts is crucial!)*

- [ ] **Unbounded PCollections**  
  - How streaming data differs from batch  
  - Why windowing and triggers are needed

- [ ] **Common Windowing Strategies**  
  - Fixed windows (e.g., 1-minute windows)  
  - Sliding windows  
  - Session windows

- [ ] **Triggers & Watermarks**  
  - Event-time vs. processing-time triggers  
  - Late data handling (out-of-order events)  
  - Accumulation modes (discarding vs. accumulating)

- [ ] **Practical Examples**  
  - Real-time aggregations (count per minute, top-N)  
  - Handling late data with side outputs

**Goal**: Acquire a foundation in streaming concepts so you can handle real-time, unbounded data.

## Runners: Write Once, Run Anywhere

- [ ] **Beam’s Runner Abstraction**  
  - Popular runners: **DirectRunner**, **DataflowRunner**, **SparkRunner**, **FlinkRunner**  
  - Why use different runners (local testing vs. cloud deployment)

- [ ] **How to Switch Runners**  
  - Minimal changes in code or command-line parameters  
  - Example usage (e.g., `--runner=DataflowRunner`)

- [ ] **Performance & Scaling Considerations**  
  - Comparing Spark vs. Flink vs. Dataflow  
  - DirectRunner for local debugging

**Goal**: Understand how to seamlessly move pipelines between environments and scale to production workloads.

---

## Testing & Debugging Your Beam Pipelines

- [ ] **Unit Tests for Transforms**  
  - Testing `ParDo` logic with framework-specific tools  
  - Example: `pytest` for Python

- [ ] **Integration Testing**  
  - Using **DirectRunner** for end-to-end local testing  
  - Mock I/O vs. real I/O strategies

- [ ] **Logging & Monitoring**  
  - Basic logging patterns in Beam (e.g., Python `logging`)  
  - Cloud-based monitoring dashboards when using Dataflow or managed services

**Goal**: Ensure correctness and reliability of your pipelines before running large-scale jobs.

## Best Practices and Patterns

- [ ] **Code Organization**  
  - Structuring Beam code for clarity and modularity  
  - Leveraging composite transforms for reuse

- [ ] **Stateful Processing** (Advanced)  
  - Overview of stateful `DoFn` usage  
  - Counters or custom state management patterns

- [ ] **Side Inputs & Side Outputs**  
  - Broadcasting small reference datasets as side inputs  
  - Separating data processing flows with side outputs

- [ ] **Performance Tuning**  
  - Memory considerations for joins and group-bys  
  - Parallelism settings & worker configurations in your runner

**Goal**: Internalize recommended patterns and write clean, efficient, maintainable Beam code.
